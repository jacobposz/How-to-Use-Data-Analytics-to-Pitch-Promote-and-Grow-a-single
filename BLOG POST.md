If you’re a music marketer, music promoter or independent artist and aren’t 100% sure how to pitch, promote and grow your artist's single properly, don’t sweat it.

The reality? Pitching, promoting and growing a song is a major struggle for most music marketers, promoters and artists out there.

And hey, I totally understand why.

From coming up with the right words to say in a pitch to finding the right promotion strategy, a correct rollout for a single requires some serious effort.

With that said, the benefits of properly pitching, promoting and growing a song are worth racking your brain for. The downstream growth and future traffic you can drive to your artist’s Spotify page through a successful single rollout will pay dividends!

The takeaway? Learning how to successfully pitch, promote and grow a song using data analytics.

That’s why I put together this guide breaking down the stages of a successful single rollout and how to perform one yourself, using data analytics.

## Stage 1 - Pitch

The first tool that I suggest you use prior to your artist’s single’s release day (at least 30 days before release) is Chartmetric. Chartmetric is a music analytics solution, which helps digital marketers, music supervisors and artist managers monitor chart performance, social key performance indicators (KPIs), albums and audience demographics to streamline decision-making processes. Anyone with a Chartmetric Pro account can track playlists' acoustic characteristics or follower counts and search for similar artists based on genre. Moreover, Chatmetric enables Pro account users to gain insights into artists' performance across multiple music streaming and social media channels including YouTube, TikTok, Spotify, Apple Music and Instagram. Chartmetric Pro users can export data tables in PNG, JPEG, SVG, CSV and XLS file or image format. Additionally, Chartmetric Pro users can utilize an artists and repertoire (A&R) dashboard to discover new talent by sorting or filtering playlists. Lastly, Chartmetric allows Chartmetric Pro users to summarize music charts data in the form of graphs based on duration, genre or age, among other categories. 

The reason why I suggest using Chartmetric is because it's widely used by both music marketers and musicians and highly-acclaimed by music marketers and music labels. Chartmetric is essentially a database for music, but it also provides a bunch of really cool features that have been gaining traction in the music industry. One of the features that you should use pre-release and pre-pitch of your artist’s single is the “Playlist Journey” feature. This feature essentially tracks the “journey” of all songs on a target playlist; it visualizes the tracks’ commonly occurring playlists and displays the percentage overlap between the playlists. You will find this feature to be extremely helpful and is what will help you find the correct Spotify curated playlists to pitch your artist’s song to based on the song’s micro-genre. Other features that you should consider using during the pre-release and pre-pitch phase of the single is how long songs last in a specific playlist, how new the tracks are in a specific playlist (based on date added) and date and time of when songs are added and removed from a specific playlist.

Prior to using the “playlist journey” feature to figure out the exact micro-genre of your artist’s single, I suggest using the “similar playlists” feature to see what other artists are in your artist’s micro-genre and the exact playlists that their songs were being added to. Through the “Playlist Journey” feature, you can end up finding a few smaller Spotify curated playlists that fit your artist’s single’s micro-genres; you may end up pitching to these playlists prior to release day.

## Stage 2 - Promotion

The second tool that I suggest you use post release (the day after the single is released) to help promote your artist’s single is Spotify’s ‘Marquee’ tool. Marquee is a full-screen, sponsored recommendation of an artist’s new release to Spotify Free and Premium listeners who have shown interest in an artist’s music and have the potential to listen more. When a listener clicks on a Marquee, they are guided to an artist’s new release—and that artist’s release alone. To qualify, an artist needs at least 15K streams in the US over the past 28 days (which my artist had), or more than 2.5K US followers (which my artist also had). The way that Marquee works is that when members of an artist’s “reachable audience” open the Spotify app, they’re greeted with a full-screen recommendation to check out that artist’s new release.

The reason why I suggest you use Marquee post release is because you want to drive as much traffic as possible to your artist’s song during the first month, as the 1-month period post-release is when curators evaluate to see how a song performed over the month if the song was not originally added pre-release. In short, more traffic increases the probability of a curator adding the song to their playlist, if they did not originally add it when it was pitched.

Unlike other paid marketing tools, Marquee allows artists to target listeners based on their listening history rather than broad demographics or interests. It also reaches listeners right when they're deciding what to listen to rather than when they're scrolling a feed. Finally, Marquee’s reporting measures the impact on music listening and fan engagement. It's the perfect tool to use post-release to promote your artist’s single.

In my own Marquee campaign that I ran to promote my artist’s latest single, I saw great results from Marquee. The campaign ended up only spending $116.50 total out of the $210.00 I had invested. What does this mean? It means that Spotify over-estimated what my artist’s reachable audience (a group of listeners who have followed my artist or shown interest in his music and are likely to find the Marquee campaign relevant) was / was not as efficient at promoting my artist’s single as Spotify thought it would be. Nonetheless, through Marquee, I reached (people who saw the campaign) 1,712 listeners more listeners, had 233 more clicks (clicks to the release), 149 more converted listeners (people who streamed the release after seeing the campaign), an increase in conversion rate of 8.68% (percentage of people streamed the release after seeing the campaign), an increase of 8.71 streams / listener (average number of active streams per converted listener who streamed the song after seeing the campaign), a increase in intent rate of 39.6% (number of converted listeners who saved or playlisted the song after streaming), 28 additional playlists adds for the song and an increase in save rate of 30.2% (number of of converted listeners who saved a track).

Moreover, 21 of the converted listeners from the Marquee campaign also streamed my artist’s other releases after seeing the campaign. We also had a 9.67 average streams of my artist’s other releases per converted listener, 5 total tracks of my artist's other releases added to playlists by converted listeners and 2 total tracks of my artist’s other releases saved by converted listeners. The only caveat about using Marquee was that Spotify only considered people in the United States who they thought would listen to my artist; listeners in every other country where Spotify is currently available were not considered. However, Spotify has announced that they are going to make Marquee available to the rest of the world by 2024.

## Stage 3 - Growth

The third and final tool that I suggest you use to grow your artist’s single is Spotify’s ‘Discovery Mode’ tool. According to Spotify, their data shows that artists with tracks in Discovery Mode find 40% more listeners on average. Moreover, Spotify stated that 44% of those new listeners had never listened to the artist before – so the Discovery Mode recommendations seem to be working (at least according to Spotify). However, there is a caveat; the Discovery Mode algorithm can be unpredictable. Spotify states, “There’s no guarantee that your music will be recommended to the right listeners at the right time.” This might sound concerning to you at first. However, in my opinion, the potential benefits of Discovery Mode outweighed the potential risks. Moreover, since Discovery Mode is so new, there is also the element of the unknown which is always a risk, but one that could end up paying dividends. 

Through the Discovery Mode campaign that I ran to grow my own artist’s single, I saw an increase of 2,091 listeners (total number of unique listeners streaming from Radio and Autoplay, including new listeners), an increase of 155% in listener lift (the rate at which my artist’s average number of daily listeners changed during this campaign period), 1,120 new listeners, an increase of 25 saves (the number of times a song was saved by a listener reached in Radio and Autoplay), an increase of 15 playlist adds (The number of times a song was added to a playlist by a listener reached in Radio and Autoplay), an increase of 2,967 total streams (the total number of streams in Radio and Autoplay contexts), a 195% increase in stream lift (the rate at which your average number of daily streams in Radio and Autoplay changed during this campaign period) and an increase of 1.48% intent rate (the percentage of listeners who saved or playlisted the track after streaming it).

## Conclusion

Successfully pitching, promoting and growing your artist’s single isn’t as simple as it seems.

At the end of the day, your end goal should be to get your artist’s single onto a Spotify editorial playlist either pre-release or 1 month after release through successful promotion.

With the help of these tips and plenty of your own research and practice, you can do exactly that sooner rather than later.
